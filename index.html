    <h2 style ="color:gold;">INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p><i><b>The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that guides the development of software from initial concept to final deployment and maintenance.<br>It's a framework that breaks down the complex task of software creation into a series of well-defined stages, ensuring quality, efficiency, and alignment with business goals. Essentially, SDLC provides a roadmap for teams to systematically plan, build, test, and maintain software, minimizing risks and optimizing resource allocation.</i></b></p>
    <h3>TYPES OF SDLC PHASES</h3>
<h4 style="color: green;">1.REQUIREMENT GATHERING</h4>

<P><b>Collecting and documenting the requirements of the software.</b></P>
<h4 style="color:pink;">2.SYSTEM DESIGN</h4>
<p><b>Designing the architecture and components of the software.</b></p>
<h5 style="color: orange;">3.IMPLEMENTATION</h5>
<p><b>Writing the code for the software.</b></p>
<h6 style="color: indigo">4.TESTING</h6>
<p><b>Testing the software to ensure it meets the requirements.</b></p>
<h7 style="color: yellow;">5.DEPLOYMENT</h7>
<p><b>Deploying the software to the production environment.</b></p>
<h8 style="color: brown;">6.MAINTENANCE</h8>
<p><b>Maintaining and updating the software to ensure it continues to meet the requirements.</b></p>

<tr><th>MODEL NAME</th><th>USE CASE</th><th>DRAW BACKS</th></tr>

<tr><td><b>Water fall model</b></td><td><b>The waterfall model is best suited for projects with well-defined and stable requirements, where changes are minimal and the project scope is relatively fixed</b></td>

<td><b>limited flexibility, delayed testing, and high risk</b></td>

</tr>

<tr><td><b>Agile model</b></td><td><b>The Agile model in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is best suited for projects with evolving requirements, where frequent feedback and collaboration are crucial</b> </td><td><b>Development Life Cycle (SDLC). One significant disadvantage is the potential for scope creep due to the iterative and flexible nature of Agile, which can lead to increased costs and delayed

timelines if not properly managed.</b></td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Spiral model</b></td><td><b>The Spiral Model in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is best suited for large, complex, and high-risk projects where requirements are unclear or evolving, and where continuous risk assessment and management are crucial.</b> </td>

<td><b>These include high cost and complexity, dependence on risk analysis expertise, difficulty in time management, and the potential for projects to continue indefinitely.

<h10 style="color:grey;"><b>SUMMARY</b></h10>
<p><b>Software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software.<br> SDLC, or software development life cycle, is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step. <br>The goal of the SDLC life cycle model is to deliver high-quality, maintainable software that meets the user's requirements.<br> SDLC in software engineering models outlines the plan for each stage so that each stage of the software development model can perform its task efficiently to deliver the software at a low cost within a given time frame that meets users requirements.<br> In this article we will see Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in detail.</b></p></font>
